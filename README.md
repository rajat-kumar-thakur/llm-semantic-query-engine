# llm-semantic-query-engine

The `llm-semantic-query-engine` is a powerful and intuitive system designed to provide intelligent, context-aware responses by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic querying. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, this engine understands the intent and meaning behind your queries, fetching relevant information from a designated knowledge base.

This project aims to bridge the gap between natural language understanding and structured data retrieval, making information access more intuitive and efficient for users.

## Features

-   **Semantic Querying**: Understands the meaning and intent of user queries, not just keywords.
-   **LLM Integration**: Leverages powerful Large Language Models for generating context-aware responses.
-   **Vector Database Integration**: Utilizes Pinecone (or similar) as a vector database for efficient semantic search over a knowledge base.
-   **Context-Aware Responses**: Provides answers that are relevant to the query's context and derived from the integrated knowledge base.
-   **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle increasing query loads and knowledge base sizes.
-   **Web Interface**: Simple web UI for interacting with the query engine (via Flask/Jinja2).

## Architecture Overview

The `llm-semantic-query-engine` operates on a principle of semantic retrieval and generation. Here's a high-level overview:

1.  **Query Input**: A user submits a natural language query via the web interface or a script.
2.  **Embedding Generation**: The input query is transformed into a high-dimensional vector embedding using a pre-trained embedding model (often part of the LLM ecosystem).
3.  **Semantic Search (Vector Database)**: This embedding is then used to perform a similarity search against a knowledge base stored in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone). The search retrieves the most semantically relevant chunks of information.
4.  **Contextual Augmentation**: The retrieved information chunks, along with the original query, are fed into a Large Language Model as context.
5.  **Response Generation**: The LLM processes this combined input to generate a coherent, context-aware, and accurate response.
6.  **Output**: The generated response is returned to the user.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
-   **pip**: Python package installer (usually comes with Python).
-   **Virtual Environment**: Recommended for managing dependencies.
-   **API Keys**:
    -   An API key for your chosen Large Language Model provider (e.g., OpenAI API Key).
    -   Pinecone API Key and Environment (if using Pinecone as your vector database).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rajat-kumar-thakur/llm-semantic-query-engine.git
    cd llm-semantic-query-engine
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment**:

    -   **On macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    -   **On Windows**:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies**:
    The `requirements.txt` file lists all necessary Python packages.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Note: If `requirements.txt` is empty, you might need to manually add common dependencies for LLM/vector DB interaction, such as `flask`, `openai`, `pinecone-client`, `python-dotenv`.)*

    Example `requirements.txt` content:
    ```
    Flask==2.3.3
    openai==1.3.0
    pinecone-client==3.0.0
    python-dotenv==1.0.0
    ```

### Configuration

The project requires several environment variables for API keys and service configurations. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

Example `.env` file:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
PINECONE_API_KEY="your_pinecone_api_key_here"
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT="your_pinecone_environment_here" # e.g., "us-west-2"
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME="your-knowledge-base-index" # Name of your Pinecone index
# Add any other specific configurations here, e.g., LLM model name
LLM_MODEL_NAME="gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

**Important**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and configurations. **Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.**

---

## Usage

### Running the Web Application

The `main.py` script likely runs the Flask web application.

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is active** and `.env` file is configured.
2.  **Run the main application**:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3.  **Access the application**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or whatever address Flask indicates). You should see a simple interface to input queries.

### Using the Tester Script

The `tester.py` script can be used to test the core query engine functionality directly without the web interface. This is useful for debugging or integrating the engine into other applications.

Example `tester.py` usage (assuming it has a function to call the engine):

```python
# tester.py (example content)
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from main import query_engine_function # Assuming main.py exposes a function

load_dotenv() # Load environment variables

if __name__ == "__main__":
    query = "What are the benefits of semantic search?"
    print(f"Querying: '{query}'")
    response = query_engine_function(query) # Or a similar function call
    print("\n--- Response ---")
    print(response)

    query = "Tell me about Large Language Models."
    print(f"\nQuerying: '{query}'")
    response = query_engine_function(query)
    print("\n--- Response ---")
    print(response)
```

To run the tester:

```bash
python tester.py
```
